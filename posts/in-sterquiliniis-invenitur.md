'In sterquiliniis invenitur'
- In filth it will be found 
- What you need most is always to be found where you least wish to look 

'The more profound the error, the more difficult the revolution - the more fear and uncertainty released as a consequence of restructuring. The things that are most informative are also frequently most painful. Under such circumstances, it is easy to run away. The act of running away, however, transforms the ambivalent unknown into that which is too terrifying to face. Acceptance of anomalous information brings terror and possibility, revolution and transformation. Rejection of unbearable fact stifles adaptation, and strangles life. We choose one path or another at every decision point in our lives, and emerge as the sum total of our choices. In rejection our errors, we gain short-term security - but throw away our identity with the process that allows us to transcend our weaknesses, and tolerate our painfully limited lives'

'Face what you reject, accept what you refuse to acknowledge, and you will find the treasure that the dragon guards.'
