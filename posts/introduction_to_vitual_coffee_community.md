Hello VC Community,

I'm really liking this place and I figure it's time to say 'hi' and get more involved.

I'm not sure how to introduce myself. I have a very diverse background and I'm an odd-ball mix of creative and analytical.

Here we go 😬

🔨🔥 👨💬 **Career background**:    
 - food service, yoga instructor, pedicab driver, wildland firefighter, personal trainer program coordinator, volunteer board treasurer for non-profit, maintenance technician for Parks and Rec, health and fitness coach with ambitions of being a board certified wellness coach

'----   
🎓 **Educational background**: 
- CISCO networking vocational program in highschool, started out college in a computer science program with aims of being a software developer, developed a fear that my life would be like 'Office Space', switched to philosophy with intentions of studying the foundations of CBT, dropped out and wrestled with an existential crisis for many years, went back to college and focused on Public Health and Health Sciences.

'----   
⛰️🌟  **Special skill**: 
- one-on-one interpersonal communication. <br />
I've spent over a decade focusing on improving my communication and relationship skills and trying to figure out how to interact with people (I feel like I gravitate more towards the periphery of society, in the gradient between explored territory and unexplored territory). 

'----   
🤸 **For fun**: 
- I really enjoy Korean shows on Netflix, in a similar way that I've very much enjoyed Japaneese anime. I'm particuarly attracted to how they convey relationship status through their speech. For example, the different ways to communicate nuances of ['I love you'](https://www.wikihow.com/Say-I-Love-You-in-Korean)
- I adore acroyoga
- **I enjoy authentic conversations. Let's chat sometime :)**

'----   
📍 👨‍💻  **What am I up to right now in the tech domain?**
- Looking to make a break-in to the tech field and find out how I can best contribute.
    - I've recently begun to consider that my skills could be well applied as a liason between a tech team and other stakeholders. Pretty similar to my role as program coordinator for a University's personal training program, similar to work I've done with a non-profit, and similar to work I've done as a personal trainer and health coach (many of my clients worked at the nearby Intel campus, or the IT department of Nike).
     - Volunteered to help with Life Church's Open Network team, but it seems like I've been ghosted (ouch, lol.)
- I'm finishing up fullstack program through Thinkful (they were bought out by Chegg and completly changed the program - do not reccomend).
- On the side, I've been playing around with Unix a bit. Set up a headless raspberry pi on my wireless network just as a learning project, and I mess around with WSL2 now and then. Nothing too intense, just little things here and there to learn.
- I recently came across the JAM stack when looking up ideas on creating a simple blog that utilizes markdown files (my main journaling media). Now I'm wanting to keep going down this rabbit hole and build something with 11ty and Agility CMS.
- I have a reoccuring notion that that which will move me forward towards the life and person that I want to be is sharing my stories (putting myself out there) - this introduction post is a bubmling attempt to do so.

👉 I respond well to straight-forward criticism. Any criticism of my online presence and work is welcome with open arms and would be considered a gift 💙🎁 



I look forward to being more involved in this community and getting to know more of you 🙇
